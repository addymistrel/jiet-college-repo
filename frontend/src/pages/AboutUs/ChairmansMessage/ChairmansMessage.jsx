                      In 1998, perseverance and high goals of founder Shri Anil
                      Kumar Bansal establishes JIND Education Trust Under his
                      dynamic leadership, in a span of over 2 decades, JIET
                      Group of Institutions has become one of the nation's most
                      trusted educational group. These institutions have
                      broadened the horizons of youth and enriched them with
                      their culture of excellence, social service and
                      inclusiveness. It was in the early 1990s that I was deeply
                      concerned about the regional imbalance in the facilities
                      available for Technical Education. No doubt there were
                      quite a few Engineering Colleges in our state and our
                      students were deprived of the fruits of Technical
                      Education. Jind Education Trust laid the foundation of
                      Jind Institute of Engineering & Technology (JIET) in 1998,
                      Jind Polytechnic College in 2007 (JPC) and JIET Convent
                      School in 2018.
